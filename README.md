# kDocs-Terminal-Plus
This is a better version of kDocs-Terminal. We recommend you replace the old kDocs-Terminal with this one. In this README.md file, it will teach you what to do when you download these scripts. Scripts made by Lewar Hassan, creator of CashManScripts!

# Installation

To install this script, click on "Code" and click on "Download ZIP". If you are getting asked for a password, the password is **1helesa**.

# Security

To keep your password and username safe, you have to hide the **user** folder, and to do that you have to follow these steps:

If you are running a macOS PC,
1. Open your Terminal
2. Write the following commands: ``cd (where the kDocs folder is)`` and ``chflags hidden user``

If you'd like to unhide the folder, write these following commands: ``cd (where the kDocs folder is)`` and ``chflags nohidden user``

Else:
1. Open the kDocs-Terminal folder
2. Right-click on the **user** folder
3. Click on **Properties**
4. Check the box which says **Hidden**

# Commands

If you'd like, you don't have to read this and you can just enter the command "-help" on the app.
But if you'd like to read it here, here are the commands:

1. print: Make the computer say something
2. new_file: Create a new file
3. del_file: Delete a file
4. name_file: Rename a file
5. file: Manage a file
6. -cmd: Go into CMD mode, one CMD command at a time!
